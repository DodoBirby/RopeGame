Changes I want to make

Mechanics
- Reeling in/out system for tether
- Increase player friction when landing
- Sync Buttons on same Layers
- Start grandpa awake on new level/reset
- Tweak Rope momentum to decay if not pressing a button
- Tweak rope momentum to not instantly change direction when pressing
- Add checkpoints
- Add Rope Snapping if Grandpa falls out of Player's max rope range


Later, not Now
- Grandpa follows player when awake, within reason (won't fall 2+ tile large gaps)
- Grandpa Tow Mode: When awake and hanging:(control grandpa with arrows, reel in/out with up/down to guide the player.)


HUD
- Add Hearts to HUD
- Restore HP system


Levels
- I want to make more levels
- Tutorial level needs extra stuff for standing on grandpa, and raise the door throw spot so you need both rope upgrades in the room.
- Make the door require an interact to use


Aesthetics
- Make custom tileset so we aren't lookin like Cave Story fr fr


Quality of Life/Settings
- Change Jump button
- Add control remapping
- Better resolution settings
- Raise default volume sliders, lower base volume
-
